Whenver you start a new technology, you can check out [100 seconds of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC471a9qrU4&list=PL0vfts4VzfNiI1BsIK5u7LpPaIDKMJIDN) to uderstand it better while also glancing over the official docs. When learning data structures and algorithms, you should start by understand the language agnostic theory, then understand language specific theory and then do the leetcode problems from the roadmap.
