Whenver you start a new technology, you can check out [100 seconds of Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC471a9qrU4&list=PL0vfts4VzfNiI1BsIK5u7LpPaIDKMJIDN) to uderstand it better while also glancing over the official docs. When learning data structures and algorithms, you should start by understand the language agnostic theory, then understand language specific theory and then do the leetcode problems from the roadmap. For each language you should solve the same algos and data structure problems so you can enforce the knowledge from a different perspective. Along the way you should pick up some linux, bash, git, and docker.

## Learning schedule

300 total hours of theory and practice.

## Final project

Build a full stack e-commerce app with each tech stack. Use each the advantages of each technology. 225 hours of practice.

#### App requirements:

- Product page with pagination.
- Product filters and rudimentary search.
- User authentication and accounts with order history.
- Global cart with persistance.
- Checkout with client side validation.
- Server validation of orders.
- Email confirmation.
- Admin dashboard with CRUD operations of db.
- Admin dashboard with at least 2 charts.

All apps will use the same database.

| Project                         | Stack          | Hours | Status |
| ------------------------------- | -------------- | ----- | ------ |
| Ecom site with JS ecosystem     | React + NodeJs | 35    |        |
| Ecom site with Python ecosystem | VueJs + Django | 60    |        |
| Ecom site with Go ecosystem     | Angular + Gin  | 60    |        |
| Ecom site with Rust ecosystem   | Yew + Rocket   | 70    |        |

Deployment for each app will be on a server with the same capabilities for all apps. Each app will be in a docker container.

After completing all of these you should go and learn systems design, networking, and security.
